# Driven Eats
the idea is to make a simple and usefull website for a fictional food company\
the user must choose one product out of each type of product and after choosing\
their order the user must be redirected to whatsapp with a prepared message 
## How to use
1. choose one dish, then chose one drink and finally one dessert (you can only choose one of each)
2. the "end order" button will be enabled, if you click it a confirmation message will apear with your order details
3. now you can choose to cancel your order or to confirm it
4. if you cancel your order you will go back to the choosing screen
5. if you confirm it you will be redirected to the restaurant whatsapp with a prepared message containing your order
